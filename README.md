This Google Chrome extension does not read, store or keep any of you data. It simply display a button when on the offers page for American Express that allows the offers to be automatically clicked until there are none left. You can reload the page and continue clicking them if Amex re-populates offers for you as max of 100 are displayed at any one time.
